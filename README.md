# Crowdin Go client

The Crowdin Go client is a lightweight interface to the Crowdin API. It provides common services for making API requests.

Our API is a full-featured RESTful API that helps you to integrate localization into your development process. The endpoints that we use allow you to easily make calls to retrieve information and to execute actions needed.
